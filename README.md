# SAS2022-PhotometryWorkshop

Date: 2 June 2022

Location: Ontario

[Registration: ](https://socastrosci.org/symposium/)

Abstract
--------

Compare and contrast steps leading to publishing data using old and
new CCD as well as newer CMOS and newest sCMOS cameras. People are
asked to take a series Bias, Dark, Flat and Calibration images from
their photometry and spectrograph instruments. Discussion of evaluating
and publishing Signal-to-noise ratios through a understanding of
all noise sources that roll into published results.

The workshop is concerned with making the master files, and steps
to convert ADU to photon-counts for calibration and science images.
Aspects of image analysis is left to other workshops and courses.

Code and notes for this workshop will be on GitHub. Documentation for
this workshop will be at ReadTheDocs.io.
